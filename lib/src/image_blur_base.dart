    /// with a blank image.

    /// * Option B ([gaplessPlayback] = true): The widget displays the avatar of
    /// the previous person and the name of the newly loaded person.

    /// the image provider you're not just changing the image, you're removing the

    /// relationship. With [gaplessPlayback] on you might accidentally break this
    /// expectation and re-use the old widget.

    /// If this is null, this widget will display an image that is painted as

    /// if it becomes available asynchronously). Callers might use this builder to

    /// be passed as the `child` argument to the [loadingBuilder]. For example,
